Improvements file for bettermon.sh script
Author: Jacob McCrae
Date Created: July 31, 2014

To view the bettermon.sh script correctly, please zoom out the terminal screen before executing the script so that the font size is smaller. If this is not done
then everything pushes back up on top of eachother and creates a garbled mess.

Features Added in the bettermon.sh script:

1. Colourized Bar Graphs
	- implemented as describe in project pdf
2. Disk Usage Graph
	- d to toggle on or off
3. Time Delay between Updates
	- increase and decrease time delay using +/- keys
	- does not allow the time delay to be less than or equal to 0 for implementation, resets time delay to 1 if 0
